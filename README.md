# Project Description and API

## Motivation
- Technology for people with discomfort requires more improvement and effort
- ~1.1 Million blind people in the US alone
- Products for the blind are either very expensive or not helpful
- A lot of technical challenges can be overcome by advanced computer vision algorithms and deep learning neural network
- Portability +  Accuracy +  Reliability = Wearable Device 


## Overall Architecture

## Hardware Specification

- Since it is a wearable device, we focused on making the prototype simple and lightweight
- External Aux: Either connects to the speaker or headphones
- USB Microphone


## Software Specification

- Flask-Ask API: Rapid Alexa Skills kit Development: Helps construct ask and tell responses
- Tensorflow (deep-learning workstation; machine learning engine): for training process (natural language processing)
- YOLO V2: real-time object detection system proposed by Joseph Redmon. Relatively simple algorithm but very very fast
- Paramiko API(implementation of the SSHv2 protocol) to communicate between server on Pi 3 and client (by linux command)

## Manual
- Upon userâ€™s command, REST API Server triggers snapshot.py on Pi3
- Photo from Pi automatically transfers to the main computer
- Main computer classifies the object and POSTs the output result to the server that is integrated with AlexaPi
- AlexaPi spits out the result in word
